## Testing instruction:

### Pre-requisite:
All following commands are executed in the same directory as main.go (cmd/tftp).

Start server command: `./tftp`

In another terminal window:

Test write: `bash write_test.sh`

Test read: `bash read_test.sh`

Logs are recorded in "tftpRegistry.log"

Notes: Need the make the write request first, and then read request, since hello.txt needs to be written to server first before being read. 
The second write request will lead to already-exist error. However, by restarting the server you can make write request once again, because data is just written into memory.
