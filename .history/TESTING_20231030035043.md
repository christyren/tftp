## Testing instruction:

All following commands are executed in the same directory as main.go (cmd/tftp).

I added two .sh file for testing "write" and "read" request.

Start server command: `./tftp`

In another terminal window:

Test write: `bash write_test.sh`

Test read: `bash read_test.sh`

Logs are recorded in "tftpRegistry.log"

Notes: Need the make the write request first, and read request
