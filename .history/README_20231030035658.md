# In-memory TFTP Server

This is a simple in-memory TFTP server, implemented in Go.  It is
RFC1350-compliant, but doesn't implement the additions in later RFCs.  In
particular, options are not recognized.

# Usage

This is a custom tftp server running on port 6969.  You can use a tftp client to test read and write functionality. You can read 

# Testing

### Pre-requisite:
All following commands are executed in the same directory as main.go (cmd/tftp).


### Commands:
Start server command: `./tftp`

In another terminal window:

Test write: `bash write_test.sh`

Test read: `bash read_test.sh`

Logs are recorded in "tftpRegistry.log"

### Notes: 

1. Make the write request first and then read request, since hello.txt needs to be written to server first before being read. 
2. A second write request will lead to already-exist error. However, by restarting the server you can make write request once again, because data is just written into memory.
