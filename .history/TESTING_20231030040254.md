## Testing instruction:

### Pre-requisite:
All following commands are executed in the same directory as main.go, which is "cmd/tftp". Assume you have tftp installed. I have a Mac so it's already installed.


### Commands:
Start server command: `./tftp`

In another terminal window:

Test write: `bash write_test.sh`

Test read: `bash read_test.sh`

Logs are recorded in "tftpRegistry.log"

### Notes: 

1. Make the write request first and read request second, since hello.txt needs to be written first before being read. 
2. A second write request will lead to already-exist error. However, by restarting the server you can make write request once again, since data is only written into memory.
