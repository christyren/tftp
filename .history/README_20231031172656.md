# In-memory TFTP Server

This is a simple in-memory TFTP server, implemented in Go.  It is
RFC1350-compliant, but doesn't implement the additions in later RFCs.  In
particular, options are not recognized.

# Usage

This is a custom tftp server running on port 6969.  You can use a tftp client to write (put) a file and read (get) from the server. Any length of text can be sent. I tested it with a txt file. Video files can also be read and written.

# Testing

### Pre-requisite:
All build and testing commands are executed in the same path as main.go, which is "cmd/tftp". Assume tftp is installed. We will use it as client. I use the default one on Macbook.

### Commands:

Build: `go build`

Start server: `./tftp`

In another terminal window:

Test write: `bash write_test.sh`

Test read: `bash read_test.sh`

Logs are recorded in "tftpRegistry.log"

### Error handling

1. When you send write request with the same filename the second time, you get a "File already exists" error.
2. When you send read request with a unknown filename, you get a "File not defined" error.
3. If your transfer is broken during transfer, you will get "Unknown transfer ID 


### Notes: 

1. Make the write request first and read request second, since hello.txt needs to be written first before being read. 
2. A second write request will lead to already-exist error. However, by restarting the server you can make write request once again, since data is only written into memory.
