UDP?

It depends on what you’re doing online and the type of data being transferred. UDP is better if you’re gaming online, because its speedy data transfer allows for mostly lag-free gaming. TCP is better if you’re transferring files, like family photos, because it ensures the data arrives exactly as it was sent.

Overall, TCP and UDP are both useful protocols, so to think in terms of TCP vs UDP is a bit misleading. But depending on the type of data transfer, TCP or UDP might be better for the job. Here are some examples:

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages of TCP and UDP:
Advantages of TCP

Transmission control protocol (TCP) is the protocol to choose for maximum reliability and quality. It may not be the fastest, but it gets the job done right. Here are a few advantages of the TCP protocol:

    It sets up and maintains a connection between sender and receiver.

    It operates independently of the operating system.

    It supports many routing protocols.

    It checks for errors, guaranteeing data arrives at its destination unaltered.

    It confirms data arrival after delivery, or attempts to retransfer.

    It’s able to send data in a particular sequence.

    It optimizes the pace of data transmission based on the receiver.

Disadvantages of TCP

TCP isn’t suited for some types of data transfers, especially ones that require faster speeds. These are the drawbacks of TCP packet transmission:

    It uses more bandwidth and is slower than UDP.

    It’s especially slow at the beginning of a file transfer.

    It can prevent data from loading if some data is lost. For example, it won’t load images on a web page until all of the page data has been delivered.

    It reduces its transfer rate if the network is congested, resulting in even slower speeds.

    It’s not suited for LAN and PAN networks.

    It can’t multicast or broadcast.

Despite its slower speeds, TCP is the only protocol that can retransmit lost data packets. When reliability is critical, TCP is the best option.
